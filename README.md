# Expo CLI Build Error: Vague metro-resolver Module Resolution Issue

This repository demonstrates a seemingly uncommon bug encountered during Expo CLI development. The issue revolves around the `metro-resolver` module, causing build failures with vague error messages. The problem is inconsistent, working on some machines but failing on others, despite identical project configurations and dependency versions.

## Reproducing the Issue

The `bug.js` file contains a minimal example of a project that reproduces the error on the affected machine. Although it may build successfully on other machines, it will fail on the specific machine where this issue was observed due to an unknown, but possibly environment related, problem with the metro-resolver.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates a potential solution, which might involve reviewing and potentially cleaning the cache directories for metro-resolver or Expo CLI. In certain cases, reinstalling node modules or even cleaning the entire node_modules folder and reinstalling dependencies could resolve the issue.

## Troubleshooting Steps

1. **Clear Expo and Metro Bundler Cache:** This can often resolve issues with cached modules or configurations.
2. **Reinstall Node Modules:** Run `npm install` or `yarn install` to ensure all dependencies are properly installed.
3. **Check Node Version:** Ensure that you are using the recommended Node.js version for Expo.
4. **Check Environment Variables:** Look for any conflicting or improperly set environment variables that might affect the build process.
5. **Review Project Dependencies:** Check the `package.json` file for any dependency conflicts or outdated packages.

This is a workaround rather than a direct solution to the underlying problem, which might need more investigation if consistent issues persist after attempting these steps.
