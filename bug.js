While building an Expo project, I encountered an error related to the 'metro-resolver' module.  The error message was vague, mentioning issues resolving modules but not pinpointing the exact cause. The project built fine on other machines, but failed consistently on my development machine despite using the same Expo version, Node version, and package dependencies. The error occurred during the 'expo start' command and halted the development server.
